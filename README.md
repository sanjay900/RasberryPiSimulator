# RasberryPiSimulator
A simulator for ENGR101 Students
It needs a bit of work as some values are way off, but when tested it does follow a line (provided you write code for it to do so)
Currently Developed commands:
- Sleep
- write_digital
- set_motor
- read_analogue
- get_pixel

This is currently only for linux users
To start up a pi emulator, run ./boot.sh
To start the simulator itself, run src/main/java/main/Main.java
